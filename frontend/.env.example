# Frontend Environment Variables

# GraphQL API Endpoint
# IMPORTANT: This is a BUILD-TIME variable (not runtime)
# The value is embedded into the static bundle during the Docker build process

# Local Development (docker-compose or npm run dev)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/graphql

# Railway Production (set as build variable in Railway dashboard)
# Use Railway internal networking for better performance and zero egress costs:
# VITE_API_URL=http://tomcruise-backend.railway.internal:4000/graphql
#
# Or use public URL (slower, counts against bandwidth):
# VITE_API_URL=https://tomcruise-backend-production.up.railway.app/graphql

# Other Deployment Platforms (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
# If deploying frontend separately from backend, use the public backend URL:
# VITE_API_URL=https://tomcruise-backend-production.up.railway.app/graphql

# NOTES:
# - For Railway: Set this in "Variables" tab of frontend service as a build-time variable
# - The Dockerfile validates this variable is set to prevent accidental localhost builds
# - Changing this value requires a rebuild, not just a restart
# - See: https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html for more on Vite env variables
